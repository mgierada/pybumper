## ⚡️Requirements

It should work with any fairly modern python tech stack. I tested that for the following:

- neovim >= 0.9 and nightly 0.10-dev releases
- poetry >= 1.5.1
- python >= 3.10.8
- pip >= 23.2.1

## 💻 Installation

Install with your favourite package manager

[Lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)

```lua
  -- Pybumper
  {
    "mgierada/pybumber.nvim",
    dependencies = { "MunifTanjim/nui.nvim" },
    config = function() require("pybumper").setup {} end,
    event = "BufRead",
  },

```

## ⚙️ Configuration

The `pybumper.nvim` comes up with the following configuration. Any of of those can be easily overridden by providing a config to setup function.

```lua
{
	colors = {
		up_to_date = "#3C4048",
		outdated = "#d19a66",
	},
	icons = {
		enable = true,
		style = {
			up_to_date = "|  ",
			outdated = "|  ",
		},
	},
	autostart = true,
	package_manager = constants.PACKAGE_MANAGERS.poetry,
	hide_up_to_date = false,
	hide_unstable_versions = false,
},

```

## 💡 Inspiration

This plugin is inspired by [`package.info.nvim`](https://github.com/vuki656/package-info.nvim) which is designed to work in the JavaScript/TypeScript environment.
